" (double-quote) in Logo used for symbol values same as ' (single-quote) in Scheme.
BUT, double-quote not working for lists like in Scheme, so following will not work:

```
"(the list)
; => I don't know how  to the
```

: (colon) are used to get the value of variable with name that goes after the
colon.

[] (square brackets) are used for lists similar to '() in Scheme
