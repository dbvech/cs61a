```logo
make "foo "foo

to outer
make "foo "bar
inner
end

to inner
print foo
end

outer
; => bar
```

because Logo has dynamic scoping it will print "bar (from inner definition
of "outer" func). If it were lexical scoping then "foo will be printer from
the scope (global) where "inner" func was created. So in Scheme the following
code will output "foo":

```lisp
(define foo 'foo)

(define (outer)
  (let ((foo 'bar))
     (inner)))

(define (inner)
  (print foo))

(inner)
; => foo
```
